### [hq-game-hack](hq-game-hack/)
It's not actually a hack. :) Back in early 2018, I wrote this python script using Selenium and tesseract OCR to see if I could automate the process of finding the answers for live trivia questions from the HQ Trivia app. Then using a recommender system approach, I try to predict the correct answer. 

*I wrote a blog post about it [here](https://pattishih.com/project-a-nostalgic-look-back-at-hq-trivia-and-my-get-rich-quick-python-automation-experiment/).*
